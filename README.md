and returns the data recieved from the server. HTTPAsk was given in the assingment. 
In task2 TCPClient class from task1 was extended so that a limit on the data received, a timeout and shutdown could be handled. HTTPAsk was given in the assignment. 
In task3 HTTPAsk class was implemented to read and analyse a HTTP get request and also composing and returning a valid HTTP resonse. TCPClient is the same as was implementet in task2.
