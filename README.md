Programming assignments in the course IK1203 course Network and Communications at KTH. 
In task1 the TCPClient class was implemented. IT opens a TCP connection to a server given a portnumber and a host address, it then sends data to the server
and returns the data received from the server. HTTPAsk was given in the assingment. 
In task2 the TCPClient class from task1 was extended so that  a limit on the data received, a timeout and shutdown could be handled. HTTPAsk was given in the assignment. 
In task3 HTTPAsk class was implemented to read and analyse a HTTP get request and also composing and returning a valid HTTP resonse. TCPClient is the same as was implementet in task2. 
In task4 HTTPAsk class from task3 was changed to be concurrent. Also here TCPClient is from task2.
